WARNING: This code is still _alpha_
		 -> very little doc, code incomplete ...

Note: You will have to build the jmeter maven artifacts yourself atm.
I'm going to add a script for this when I find the time ...
See maven-jmeter dir for some example poms to use on JMeter.

maven-jmeter/notes.txt <-- read this, if you have trouble building!

$ mvn clean install # to build this project
