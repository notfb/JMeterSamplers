<a name="Latency"><b>Latency</b></a>. JMeter measures the latency from just before sending the request to
just after the first response has been received. Thus the time
includes all the processing needed to assemble the request as well as
assembling the response, which in general will be longer than one
byte.
Protocol analysers (such as Wireshark) measure the time when bytes are actually sent/received over the interface.
The JMeter time should be closer to that which is experienced by a
browser or other application client.

<a name="Median"><b>Median</b></a> is a number which divides the samples into two equal halves.
Half of the samples are smaller than the median, and half are larger.
[Some samples may equal the median.]
This is a standard statistical measure.
See, for example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median">Median</a> entry at Wikipedia.
The Median is the same as the 50<sup>th</sup> Percentile
</p>

<p>
<a name="Percentile"><b>90% Line (90<sup>th</sup> Percentile)</b></a> is the value below which 90% of the samples fall.
The remaining samples too at least as long as the value.
This is a standard statistical measure.
See, for example: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile">Percentile</a> entry at Wikipedia.
</p>

<p>
<a name="Throughput"><b>Throughput</b></a> is calculated as requests/unit of time.
The time is calculated from the start of the first sample to the end of the last sample.
This includes any intervals between samples.
